Module 3: Deploying Microsoft Azure Stack

Lab: Confirming prerequisites and installing Microsoft Azure Stack
------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

Contoso Corporation have decided to deploy an Azure Stack Development Kit
environment to determine its capabilities and how best they would be able to use
Azure Stack.

The IT team at Contoso has been given a server to host the Azure Stack
Development Kit deployment and has been tasked with ensuring it meets the
requirements. After confirming this, the IT team must deploy the Azure Stack
Development Kit and ensure it is functioning.

-   Ensure a host meets the requirements for an Azure Stack Development Kit
    deployment.

-   Ensure the deployment of an Azure Stack Development Kit is successful.

-   Understand how Validation as a Service works.

Lab Setup

**Estimated Time:** 30 Minutes

**Host Computer** MAS-HOST01

**User Name:** AzureStack\\AzureStackAdminX

**Password:** Pa55w.rd

**Virtual Machines:** All Azure Stack VMs and AzS-RDP01.

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Ensure a host meets the requirements for an Azure Stack Development Kit
    deployment.

-   Ensure the deployment of an Azure Stack Development Kit is successful.

### Exercise 1: Confirming the Prerequisites

Scenario

Contoso must check the server they have been given meets all the requirements as
it is not one of the integrated systems from an approved OEM. You must verify
the following items

-   CPU support

-   Number and type of drives

-   Amount of memory

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Confirm the CPU meets the requirements

2.  Confirm the number of drives

3.  Confirm the quantity of memory

####   Task 1: Confirm the CPU meets the requirements

| Location | Value                          |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Computer | **MAS-HOST01**                 |
| Tool     | **Windows PowerShell Console** |
| Location | **Start**                      |
| Options  | **Run as administrator**       |

1.  In an elevated **PowerShell** console run the following PowerShell command:

>   Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor -Property Name,
>   SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions, VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled,
>   VMMonitorModeExtensions \|

>   Format-List Name, SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions,
>   VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled, VMMonitorModeExtensions

1.  Review the values returned for the following paramters:

    -   SecondLevelAddressTranslationExtensions

    -   VirtualizationFirmwareEnabled

    -   VMMonitorModeExtensions

2.  Run the following PowerShell command:

>   (Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor).Count

1.  Ensure the number returned is **2** or higher.

2.  Run the following PowerShell command:

Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Processor -Property Name, SocketDesignation,
NumberOfCores, NumberOfEnabledCore, NumberOfLogicalProcessors \| Format-List
Name, SocketDesignation, NumberOfCores, NumberOfEnabledCore,
NumberOfLogicalProcessors

1.  Ensure the **NumberOfCores** for each CPU returned is **6** or higher

2.  Leave the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** Console open

####   Task 2: Confirm the number of drives

| Location | Value                          |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Computer | **MAS-HOST01**                 |
| Tool     | **Windows PowerShell Console** |
| Location | **Start**                      |
| Options  | **Run as administrator**       |

1.  In the elevated **PowerShell** console on MAS-HOST01, run the following
    **PowerShell** command:

>   \$DiskIndexes = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DiskPartition \|
>   Where-Object -FilterScript {\$_.BootPartition -eq \$true} \| Select-Object
>   -ExpandProperty DiskIndex

1.  This will obtain the Disk Index of the disk partitions that are part of the
    boot process, whether they be VHDX file or physical disk.

2.  Enter the following PowerShell command to see the Disk Indexes and press
    enter:

>   \$DiskIndexes

1.  Run the following PowerShell command:

>   Get-PhysicalDisk \| Where-Object -FilterScript {\$DiskIndexes -notcontains
>   \$_.DeviceID} \| Format-Table FriendlyName, OperationalStatus, HealthStatus,
>   \@{Name="Size";Expression={(\$*_.Size / 1GB).ToString() + " GB"}}

1.  This shows the disks that are not part of the operating system boot process.
    You should have at least 4 disks listed.

####   Task 3: Confirm the quantity of memory

| Location | Value                          |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Computer | **MAS-HOST01**                 |
| Tool     | **Windows PowerShell Console** |
| Location | **Start**                      |
| Options  | **Run as administrator**       |

1.  In an elevated **PowerShell** console on **MAS-HOST01** run the following
    **PowerShell** command:

>   \$Memory = (Get-Ciminstance Win32_OperatingSystem \| Select-Object
>   -ExpandProperty MaxProcessMemorySize) /1GB

1.  Enter the following **PowerShell** command to see the amount of memory
    installed and press enter:

>   \$Memory

1.  To round the number, enter the following **PowerShell** command and press
    enter:

[math]::Round(\$Memory,0)

1.  This will display the amount of memory in **GB**.

2.  Close the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window

**Results**: After this exercise, you should have confirmed the hardware on
which the Azure Stack Development Kit is to be deployed meets the prerequisites.

### Exercise 2: Confirm the installation was successful

Scenario
